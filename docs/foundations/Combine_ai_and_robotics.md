# How does AI help in robotics?
Now that we understand the general concept of robotics and AI, the question arises: how can they help each other? As mentioned before, traditional robotics has often been limited by its dependence on controlled environments. Robots typically perform well when everything behaves as expected. However, as soon as unexpected changes happen, robots tend to fail. The systems do not know what to do in those situations. This is where AI can help. As mentioned before AI can be used to teach robotics systems without programming, it only requires data. AI therefore extends the operations range of the robots.  

## Examples
An example of this is how industrial manipulators are typically programmed. Instead of programming line by line, there are products that allows operators to teach the robot/cobot new task via (physical) demonstrations, voice commands or gestures. ese techniques often combine Learning from Demonstration (LfD) with Reinforcement Learning (RL), where the initial demonstration provides a starting point and RL refines the behavior to handle variations and optimize performance. Additionally, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used at the planning level to interpret natural language instructions and translate them into structured actions, making interaction more intuitive. While LLMs do not control  motion directly, they help with scaling the learned task to different scenario's and increase the adaptability. It is important to realize that this is still ongoing research and therefore not deployed in industry.

For instance, Universal Robots cobots are operated using a teach pendant. The teach pendant is a screen atteched on the cobot on which motion can be programmed. A disadvantage of this method is that the operator still requires some knowledge about programming. In an ideal scenario, one could simply demonstrate a task, and the robotic system would learn to perform it. This approach would allow for intuitive training of robots and is related to the concept of one-shot learning, where a system learns from just a single example. In this the demonstrated is used by reinforcement learning to find out how to achieve the same goal for example. 

Another well-known example of AI-enhanced robotics is Spot, the robot dog developed by Boston Dynamics. Spot was previously controlled using Model Predictive Control (MPC). As the name suggests, MPC uses a model to predict the robot’s future movements and selects the most optimal control input based on those predictions. However, as soon  Spot  walks on a slippery surface the robot fails. It will falls down in an error stage. This issue has been resolved by extending the model predictive controller with reinforcement learning. In essence the reinforcement learning has been used to capture the dynamics which are difficult to model from a traditional perspective.

The last example is the self-driving car, without AI it is extremely difficult to build a reliable autonomous vehicle due to the infinite number of possible scenarios. AI helps by learning to recognize and respond to external factors such as pedestrians, traffic signs, and other vehicles, without needing explicit programming for every situation. It specifically helps with understanding the surroundings and making real-time decisions.

## How to deal with AI
The use of machine learning is helping robotics break through its current limitations, especially when it comes to capturing tasks or understanding systems that are hard to model with traditional methods. As mentioned earlier, machine learning shines at spotting patterns in data that are often too complex or subtle for humans to estimate accurately.     
But it’s important to see AI not as a replacement, but as an extension of existing techniques. Training AI models can be time consuming and resource intensive, so combining them with well established methods is often the smartest approach. Plus, sticking with known techniques gives engineers and researchers more control over the system. It’s easier to understand what’s happening and to have an idea of what the limitations of the system are.
