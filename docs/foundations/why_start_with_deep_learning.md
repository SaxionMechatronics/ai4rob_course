# Why start with deep learning?
In robotics, two major types of artificial intelligence are commonly used: deep learning and reinforcement learning. Each has its own strengths and ideal use cases. Reinforcement learning (RL) shines in situations where it's hard to model the environment or define a clear control strategy. Think of it like teaching a robot through trial and error, just like training a dog with treats. The robot learns by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. This makes RL especially useful in complex, dynamic tasks like autonomous navigation or robotic manipulation. On the other hand, deep learning (DL) is a powerhouse for broader applications. It’s like giving the robot a supercharged brain that can recognize patterns, interpret images, understand speech, and even predict outcomes. Deep learning is essentially a method for function approximation, it helps estimate complex relationships between inputs and outputs, which is why it's closely related to regression techniques in statistics. Interestingly, deep learning and reinforcement learning aren’t mutually exclusive. In fact, deep learning often plays a key role within reinforcement learning. For example, deep neural networks can be used to approximate value functions or policies, enabling RL to scale to high-dimensional problems. This combination is known as deep reinforcement learning. In the next section, we’ll dive deeper into how deep learning connects to regression, and why this relationship is so powerful in robotics and beyond.

Understanding the basics of deep learning is essential before diving into reinforcement learning. Since deep learning provides the foundation for approximating functions and handling complex data, it sets the stage for more advanced AI techniques used in robotics. In the next section, we’ll explore how deep learning connects to regression, and why this relationship is so crucial for building intelligent robotic systems.
