# Foundations Module

## Overview

This module focuses on a general introduction robotics and AI. It will be discused on what is robotics and AI, the advantage of combine AI and robotics, but also the challenge. The final part of the course will be a quick introduction into deep learning. 

## Topics Covered

- **Introduction to Robotics**: It defines what we understand what robotics is.

- **Introduction to artifical intelligence**: We will discus the field of Artificial intelligence on a higher level, so what types are there.

- **AI helping robotics**: In this module it is explained how AI can enhance the performance within robotics. 

- **Challenges in AI for robotics**:  Even though AI is very promosing, there is no such thing as free lunch. We will discuss what challenges are there within AI

- **Why start with learning**:  We end the introduction with a short introduction into deeplearning, but why do we start with deep learning and not reinforcement learning for example. 

- **Introduction to deep learning**: We will discuss the basic of deep-learning, looking into a simple feedforward net.
