## Question 1
```mcq
---
type: single
question: What is the main idea behind Reinforcement Learning?
---
- [ ] Learning from labeled examples provided by experts  
- [x] Learning through interaction and feedback from the environment  
- [ ] Learning by imitating a predefined optimal controller  
- [ ] Learning only from offline datasets  
```

---

## Question 2
```mcq
---
type: single
question: Why is RL particularly useful for robotics?
---
- [ ] Robots prefer simpler algorithms  
- [ ] RL eliminates the need for sensors  
- [x] RL allows robots to learn adaptable behaviors in complex, uncertain environments  
- [ ] RL guarantees perfect performance without training  
```

---

## Question 3
```mcq
---
type: single
question: Which of the following is a key advantage of using RL for quadruped locomotion (e.g., ANYmal)?
---
- [ ] Requires perfect terrain modeling  
- [x] Learns robust gaits without explicit terrain geometry  
- [ ] Needs a separate controller for every terrain type  
- [ ] Cannot handle slips or disturbances  
```

---

## Question 4
```mcq
---
type: single
question: In the RL learning process, what happens early in training when the agent uses random actions?
---
- [ ] The agent immediately learns optimal behavior  
- [ ] The agent receives high rewards  
- [x] The agent often performs poorly but begins gathering experience  
- [ ] The environment automatically corrects the agent  
```

---

## Question 5
```mcq
---
type: single
question: Which of the following problems is *not* suitable for RL?
---
- [ ] Environments with high uncertainty  
- [ ] Problems where the optimal solution is unknown  
- [x] Tasks with well-understood solutions and simple controllers  
- [ ] Tasks that can be simulated safely  
```
