# Wrap-up and takeaway message!
Congratulations on finishing the course! Now that you have a fundamental understanding of how AI works and can be applied, it’s important to remember that AI is not a universal solution. Careful consideration is needed to decide when it should be used. AI has great potential and has already extended the operational capabilities of many systems.
In robotics, for example, traditional techniques often struggled with generalization, especially for products where manual modeling was difficult and unexpected situations occurred. In these cases, a data-driven learning approach can be very effective. Instead of explicitly modeling everything, models can now be learned from data. This makes AI an extension of existing tools, expanding the generalizability of systems.
However, using AI everywhere comes with trade-offs. It requires large amounts of data and significant computational resources, which can be a disadvantage. Additionally, AI solutions are often highly specific: an algorithm that works well on a quadrupedal robot may not necessarily work on a humanoid robot. This “correspondence problem” remains a challenge.  In conclusion, AI should be seen as a complementary tool rather than a replacement. It enhances generalizability and adaptability, but its application must be strategic, balancing benefits against resource requirements and domain-specific constraints.
