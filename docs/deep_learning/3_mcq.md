## Question 1
```mcq
---
type: single
question: What modification is introduced in Code 3?
---
- [ ] Batch normalization  
- [ ] Dropout  
- [x] Reduced model capacity  
- [ ] Data augmentation  

```

---

## Question 2
```mcq
---
type: single
question: How does the lighter model affect performance?
---
- [ ] Significantly reduces accuracy  
- [x] Improves test accuracy through reduced overfitting  
- [ ] Increases model overfitting  
- [ ] Makes training unstable  

```

---

## Question 3
```mcq
---
type: single
question: Approximately how many parameters remain in Code 3?
---
- [x] 10.7 k  
- [ ] 107 k  
- [ ] 1 M  
- [ ] 194 k  

```

---

## Question 4
```mcq
---
type: single
question: The main reason to lighten the model is to:
---
- [ ] Increase memory consumption  
- [x] Improve generalization and efficiency  
- [ ] Introduce more layers  
- [ ] Make the network deeper  


```

---

## Question 5
```mcq
---
type: single
question: After Code 3, the model is considered:
---
- [ ] Overfitted  
- [ ] Underfitted  
- [x] Well-balanced and efficient  
- [ ] Divergent
