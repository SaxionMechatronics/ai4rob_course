## Question 1
```mcq
---
type: single
question: What is the main goal of Code 2?
---
- [ ] To finalize the optimizer choice  
- [x] To establish a consistent base architecture  
- [ ] To perform data augmentation  
- [ ] To add Dropout layers  

```

---

## Question 2
```mcq
---
type: single
question: What is the approximate parameter count in Code 2?
---
- [ ] 1 M  
- [x] 194 k  
- [ ] 10 k  
- [ ] 6 M  


```

---

## Question 3
```mcq
---
type: single
question: Which statement best describes Code 2’s outcome?
---
- [ ] Overfitting eliminated  
- [ ] Model fails to converge  
- [x] Some overfitting remains, but stable accuracy  
- [ ] Training accuracy decreased drastically  

```

---

## Question 4
```mcq
---
type: single
question: Why should the skeleton remain mostly unchanged in later steps?
---
- [ ] To make model training slower  
- [x] To ensure comparable results across experiments  
- [ ] To increase randomness  
- [ ] To add more normalization layers  

```

---

## Question 5
```mcq
---
type: single
question: The “skeleton” concept in model design mainly ensures what?
---
- [ ] Constant input shape  
- [x] Architectural consistency and comparability  
- [ ] Parameter sharing across epochs  
- [ ] Removal of activations
