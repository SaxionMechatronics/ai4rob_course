## Question 1
```mcq
---
type: single
question: What is the main purpose of Code 1?
---
- [ ] To tune the learning rate  
- [x] To set up data loading, transforms, and training loop  
- [ ] To apply batch normalization  
- [ ] To reduce parameters  
```

---

## Question 2
```mcq
---
type: single
question: Approximately how many parameters does the initial model contain?
---
- [ ] 63 k  
- [x] 6.3 M  
- [ ] 630 k  
- [ ] 630  
```

---

## Question 3
```mcq
---
type: single
question: What issue is most evident in the baseline model?
---
- [ ] Underfitting  
- [ ] Gradient explosion  
- [x] Overfitting  
- [ ] Low variance  
```

---

## Question 4
```mcq
---
type: single
question: Why is Code 1 considered a baseline?
---
- [ ] It has perfect generalization  
- [ ] It is the lightest model possible  
- [x] It provides reference performance for future experiments  
- [ ] It includes all normalization layers  
```

---

## Question 5
```mcq
---
type: single
question: Which accuracy metric shows model overfitting in this step?
---
- [x] Training accuracy >> Test accuracy  
- [ ] Training accuracy ≈ Test accuracy  
- [ ] Training accuracy < Test accuracy  
- [ ] Both accuracies are low
