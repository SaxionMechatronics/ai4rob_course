## Question 1
```mcq
---
type: single
question: What correction was made in Code 8?
---
- [ ] The learning rate scheduler was added  
- [ ] Dropout rate was changed  
- [x] MaxPooling was moved to the correct position for receptive field alignment  
- [ ] GAP layer was removed  


  
 
```

---

## Question 2
```mcq
---
type: single
question: Why does correct MaxPooling placement matter in a CNN?
---
- [x] It affects the receptive field coverage and feature hierarchy  
- [ ] It increases the number of filters  
- [ ] It reduces GPU memory usage only  
- [ ] It changes the batch normalization behavior  



```

---

## Question 3
```mcq
---
type: single
question: What is the total parameter count after adjusting MaxPooling placement?
---
- [ ] 11.9 k  
- [x] 13.8 k  
- [ ] 6 k  
- [ ] 10.7 k  



```

---

## Question 4
```mcq
---
type: single
question: What test accuracy was achieved after correcting MaxPooling placement?
---
- [x] 99.4 %  
- [ ] 97.0 %  
- [ ] 98.1 %  
- [ ] 99.0 %  


```

---

## Question 5
```mcq
---
type: single
question: What is the key observation from Code 8?
---
- [x] Model achieved stable accuracy with no overfitting  
- [ ] Model became underfitted  
- [ ] Dropout caused divergence  
- [ ] Loss continued increasing
