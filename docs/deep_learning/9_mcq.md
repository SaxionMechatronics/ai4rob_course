## Question 1
```mcq
---
type: single
question: What new concept is introduced in Code 9?
---
- [ ] Weight initialization  
- [x] Image augmentation through small rotations  
- [ ] Layer normalization  
- [ ] Regularization removal   
 
```

---

## Question 2
```mcq
---
type: single
question: What was the approximate range of rotation used for augmentation?
---
- [ ] 1–3°  
- [x] 5–7°  
- [ ] 10–15°  
- [ ] 20°  

```

---

## Question 3
```mcq
---
type: single
question: What is the main benefit of applying image augmentation?
---
- [x] It makes training data more diverse and improves generalization  
- [ ] It reduces training data size  
- [ ] It increases overfitting  
- [ ] It slows down learning intentionally  


```

---

## Question 4
```mcq
---
type: single
question: Why did training accuracy slightly drop after adding augmentation?
---
- [x] Because augmented data made the training task slightly harder  
- [ ] Due to a lower learning rate  
- [ ] Because BatchNorm was removed  
- [ ] Because of a smaller model capacity  


```

---

## Question 5
```mcq
---
type: single
question: Why did test accuracy improve after augmentation?
---
- [x] The model generalized better to unseen data variations  
- [ ] The model memorized training images more effectively  
- [ ] The learning rate increased automatically  
- [ ] The dropout rate was reduced
